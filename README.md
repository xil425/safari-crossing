# Safari Crossing ðŸŽ®

**Safari Crossing** is a Python arcade-style game inspired by *Crossy Road*, but with a safari twist.  
Players must dodge obstacles and cross busy roads in a wild safari environment. 
The goal is to avoid obstacles (trees, bushes, lions) and cross the river without falling in to score more points.
Play until 3 lives are lost and your game will end.
